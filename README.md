Here is supposed to be a collection of interactive papers. 

Each folder collects data and the Jupyter Notebooks for a paper. The notebook named 'draft' is an interactive version of the paper, which allows people to access the data easily. It should be noticed that there may be difference between the interactive paper and the submitted paper. The submitted paper should be considered as the standard version. These files may also be updated as needed.
